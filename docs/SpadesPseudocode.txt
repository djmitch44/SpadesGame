Pseudo-Code Example
Spades game (main method):
    
    Create game
    while (totalScore().compareTo(maxScore) !== 0){
        print the game state (totalScore()) then:

        Deal(), playerBid(), playerTurn().
Until:  totalScore() is reached
    Once reached
    - print an announcement that the game was won

set up the game:

    create Deck arrays foundation[0..52]
    Deck
    create a new, full 52-card deck d 
    Create 4 individual player hands with cards from Deck array in scrambled distributuion

test if the game has been won:

    initialize totalScore() to 0
    for each playerScore() add to totalScore of each team
    test is totalScore() == setTotalScore() 

print the game status (playerScore(), totalScore() ):

    print "playerScore (???)  "
    for each hand() h
        if totalScore is not reached then print " totalscore "
            endHand():
Repeat!
        
        otherwise print " winning team "+ players()
